# Transfer products from IPS Marketplace to Invisionize

As you know IPS Marketplace is closing October 30, 2023 ([You can read more here](https://invisioncommunity.com/news/invision-community/marketplace-closure-r1283/)) and I am moving all products to [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/).

## How to transfer license of my products?

1. Go to [IPS Marketplace](https://invisioncommunity.com/marketplace/) and save your license keys of products,
2. Sign up on [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/),
3. Go to [Invisionize Keys](https://forum.invisionize.pl/keys/) and enter your license keys here from [IPS Marketplace](https://invisioncommunity.com/marketplace/),
4. Done! You can download your products.
