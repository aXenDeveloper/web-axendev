# Transfer products from IPS Marketplace to Invisionize

As you know IPS Marketplace is closing October 30, 2023 ([You can read more here](https://invisioncommunity.com/news/invision-community/marketplace-closure-r1283/)) and I am moving all products to [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/).

## How to transfer license of my products?

1. Sign up on [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/),
2. Sand me a PM on [IPS Community](https://invisioncommunity.com/messenger/compose/?to=580858) with your [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/) username and which products you want to transfer,
3. Wait for my answer. I will transfer your purchases to your account.
