# Transfer products from IPS Marketplace to Invisionize

As you know IPS Marketplace is closing October 30, 2023 ([You can read more here](https://invisioncommunity.com/news/invision-community/marketplace-closure-r1283/)) and I am moving all products to [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/).

## How to transfer license of my products?

1. Go to [IPS Marketplace](https://invisioncommunity.com/marketplace/) and save your license keys of products,
2. Sign up on [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/),
3. Fill your address on [Invisionize Client Panel](https://forum.invisionize.pl/clients/addresses/),
4. Find your product on [Invisionize Marketplace](https://forum.invisionize.pl/files/) and click "Buy Now" button, but **don't pay for the product**,
5. Sand me a PM on [IPS Community](https://invisioncommunity.com/messenger/compose/?to=580858) or [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/messenger/compose/?to=19185) with your [Invisionize](https://forum.invisionize.pl/) username, which products you want to transfer and your license keys from [IPS Marketplace](https://invisioncommunity.com/marketplace/),
6. Wait for my answer. I will transfer your purchases to your account.
